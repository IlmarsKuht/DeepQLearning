# DeepQLearning Algorithms and optimizations

In this repository a DQN is implemented and multiple optimizations are applied at each step until the 
rainbow DQN implementation is reached
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298) 

Along these steps different games are tested.

Most of the code is commented with explanations, so you can follow along.

First 3 implementations (1-3) involve the game LunarLander-v2, where the agent needs to land in between the flahs
without crashing.
