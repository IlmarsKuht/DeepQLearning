# DeepQLearning Algorithms and optimizations

In this repository a DQN is implemented and multiple optimizations are applied at each step until the 
rainbow DQN implementation is reached
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298) 

Along these steps different games are tested.

Most of the code is commented with explanations, so you can follow along.

First 3 implementations (1-3) involve the game LunarLander-v2, where the agent needs to land in between the flags
without crashing.

## Example of the environment without training

## With training

Implementations 4-5 involve the game Flappy Bird, it uses an older gym version, where some functions might not be available, so they are implemented in the code iteself.

Implementation 6 is for the game catcher

Implementation 7 is for the game pong (Agent is on the right side)

Implementation 8 is for the qbert game
